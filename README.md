# Riker
Riker is a machine-learning system that takes as input logs of a subject playing the computer video poker game PokerTH, timestamps of when the events in those logs occurred (recorded separately using WatchDogs python package), and video of the subject's face as they played. Riker outputs a series of predictions as to the state of the game for that player based on what it observes them doing â€“ what facial expressions are they making? How long is it taking them to bet?
